# Local mirror of GitHub's static-analysis + widget-hardening jobs.
#
# Runs the fast, deterministic checks that GitHub CI runs but the strict
# pre-push hook (scripts/ci/pre-push-strict.sh) and publish-gate-local.sh
# do not. Catches PHPCS/PHPStan/widget-hardening regressions before push
# instead of after.
#
# This is intentionally separate from gate:publish-local because:
#   - publish-gate-local mirrors the deploy-bound test gates (PHPUnit, etc.)
#   - this script mirrors the GitHub-only static-analysis jobs
#   - the slow a11y suite gets its own command (gate:a11y-local) — running
#     a fresh DDEV install in every pre-push would make iteration painful
#
# Total runtime: ~30s-2min depending on cache state.
#
# Related entry points:
#   npm run gate:publish-local   — deploy-bound test gates (PHPUnit, etc.)
#   npm run gate:github-local    — this script (phpcs + phpstan + widget)
#   npm run gate:a11y-local      — local DDEV a11y suite (~10 min, requires DDEV)
