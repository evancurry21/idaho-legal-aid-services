# Local publish-parity preflight. Runs the same four non-deploy-bound test gates
# as the strict pre-push hook (scripts/ci/pre-push-strict.sh), without doing any
# git push, GitHub branch creation, or Pantheon deploy.
#
# Gate logic lives in scripts/ci/publish-gates.lib.sh. Both this script and
# pre-push-strict.sh source the same library, so they cannot drift.
#
# What this DOES mirror (parity with pre-push):
#   - Composer install --dry-run
#   - VC-PURE: vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.pure.xml
#   - Module quality gate: run-quality-gate.sh (incl. slow Phase 1d functional)
#   - Branch-aware promptfoo gate: run-promptfoo-gate.sh --env dev --mode auto
#     SKIPPED by default — live provider call (real Cohere). Opt in with
#     ILAS_LIVE_PROVIDER_GATE=1 or run `npm run assistant:providers:health`.
#
# What this DOES NOT do:
#   - Any `git push`, sync-check, protected-branch enforcement, or
#     detached-HEAD handling.
#   - The deploy-bound origin/master promptfoo branch (promptfooconfig.deploy.yaml
#     against a running DDEV instance) — that fires only on the actual push.
#
# A green run here means the deterministic test gates pass. To prove live
# Cohere/Voyage/Pinecone health, run `npm run assistant:providers:health`
# explicitly (or `npm run assistant:providers:health:strict` to also run the
# deploy-bound promptfoo gate).
#
# Related entry points:

#   npm run gate:assistant-functional       — only the slow Phase 1d suite
#   npm run gate:assistant-functional:filter -- <regex>  — single test
#   npm run test:assistant:phase1d          — fastest single-test loop
