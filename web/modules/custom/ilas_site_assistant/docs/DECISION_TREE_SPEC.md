- Topic detected but action unclear

### Disambiguation Questions (Max 1)

#### Topic but No Action
**User:** "I have an eviction issue"
**Response:**
```
I can help with eviction issues. What would you like to do?

[Find eviction forms] [Read eviction guide] [Apply for legal help] [Call advice line]
```

#### Apply vs Information
**User:** "divorce"
**Response:**
```
Are you looking for information about divorce or do you need legal help?

[Find divorce information] [Apply for legal help with divorce]
```

#### Forms vs Guides
**User:** "child custody"
**Response:**
```

[Find custody forms] [Read custody guide] [Apply for legal help]
```

#### Contact Disambiguation
**User:** "contact you"
**Response:**
```
How would you like to contact us?

[Call Legal Advice Line] [Find office locations] [Apply online]
```

### Disambiguation Rules
1. Maximum 1 clarifying question per conversation turn

3. Options should be 2-4 choices maximum
4. After disambiguation, route directly to selected intent

## 5. Safe Response Templates

### Template Requirements
1. **No legal advice** - Never tell users what they "should" do legally
2. **Grounded** - Only reference ILAS services and known resources
3. **Action-oriented** - Always provide clear next steps
4. **Safety-first** - Include emergency resources when relevant
5. **Accessible** - Plain language, avoid legal jargon
6. **Spanish support** - Key phrases available in Spanish

### Template Structure
```
[Acknowledgment] (1 sentence)

[Information/Context] (1-2 sentences, factual only)

[Call to Action] (Clear next steps)

[Buttons: Primary CTA] [Secondary option]
```
